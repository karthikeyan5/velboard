## What if your AI could build dashboards?

Clawboard is a real-time monitoring dashboard built entirely by an AI agent. Every panel, every WebSocket connection, every layout decision — written by an AI through [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Not scaffolded. Not templated. **Built from scratch by an agent that understands the framework.**

The 10 panels that ship are just the starting point. A panel is two files: `panel.json` + `ui.js`. Tell your agent what you want to monitor, and it creates a working panel in seconds — the framework guarantees the plumbing works.

All panels update via WebSocket. No polling. No refresh.

## Create a Panel in 60 Seconds

A panel is two files. That's it.

**`panel.json`** — metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "my-panel",
  "title": "My Panel",
  "icon": "📊",
  "size": "half"
}
```

**`ui.js`** — a Preact component:
```javascript
import { html } from '/js/lib/htm-preact.js';

export default function Panel({ data }) {
  return html`<div class="panel-content">
    <h3>${data.value}</h3>
  </div>`;
}
```

Drop the folder into `panels/`, restart. Done. Your panel is live with WebSocket streaming, layout, and error handling — all handled by the framework.

## These Are Just the Defaults

The 10 panels that ship with Clawboard are a starting point. The real magic is what comes next.

**Tell your AI agent to build a monitoring panel for:**

- Your PostgreSQL query performance
- Your API response times
- Your CI/CD pipeline status
- Your Docker containers
- Your smart home sensors
- Your stock portfolio
- *Whatever you can imagine*

The framework handles WebSocket streaming, responsive layout, data sources, error boundaries, and live updates. Your agent writes the UI. Nothing else.

**`panel.json` + `ui.js`. That's the entire contract.** Pour your imagination in — the framework takes care of making sure it works.

## 🌐 Browser Relay

Clawboard includes a built-in browser relay server that lets your AI agent remotely control a browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Pair with a 6-character code, and your agent gets full CDP access — no extensions, no port forwarding.

📖 **[Full Browser Relay documentation →](./RELAY.md)**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install into your Vel apps directory
cd your-vel-app/apps/
git clone https://github.com/karthikeyan5/clawboard.git

# Build (required — Clawboard has Go server code)
cd /path/to/vel && ./vel build

# Run
./vel start
```

---

## Built on Vel

Clawboard is a **[Vel](https://github.com/essdee/vel)** app — the AI-native Go web framework where AI agents are the primary developers.

- **Single Go binary** — no Node.js, no Python, no runtime dependencies
- **Manifest-driven** — JSON declarations, framework-guaranteed correctness
- **WebSocket-first** — real-time by default, not bolted on
- **AI writes it, framework validates it** — humans review business logic, not plumbing
