## The Problem

Every time you ask your agent *"what's my CPU?"* or *"how much quota left?"* — that's tokens in, tokens out. Seconds of waiting. Multiply by every routine check, every day.

**You're paying to read a number.**

## The Solution

Clawboard gives your OpenClaw agent a live web dashboard. WebSocket-powered. Telegram-authenticated. Zero tokens burned.

Open a tab. See everything. Done.

- **9 modular panels** — CPU, Memory, Disk, Uptime, Processes, Claude Usage, Crons, Models, OpenClaw Status (plus `_test` for development)
- **Preact+HTM UI** — Zero build step, native ES modules, ~400ms load
- **Panel contract v1.0** — Standardized props, scoped CSS via `cls()`, error boundaries
- **54 unit tests** — Co-located test.js files, `node:test` + `node:assert`
- **Live updates** — 2-second WebSocket refresh, no polling
- **Telegram auth** — Mini App (inline) + Login Widget (browser)
- **Data caching** — DeviceStorage (Mini App) + localStorage (browser), 60s TTL
- **Service Worker** — Offline-capable static assets (browser mode)
- **Config-driven** — Name, emoji, colors, traits — one JSON file
- **Personality landing page** — Animated, branded, yours
- **Extensible** — Custom panels, hooks, plugins, themes
- **Security hardened** — HMAC validation, rate limiting, signed cookies

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/karthikeyan5/clawboard.git
cd clawboard

# 2. Run the setup wizard
bash setup.sh

# 3. Done. Open your dashboard URL.
```

Or just send your agent the repo link. It reads `AGENT-SETUP.md` and handles everything.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Server | Express + ws (WebSocket) |
| UI | **Preact + HTM** — zero build step, vendored bundle |
| Auth | Telegram HMAC-SHA256 + signed cookies |
| Tests | `node:test` + `node:assert` (stdlib, no deps) |
| Styling | CSS variables, scoped via `cls()` helper |

## Panels

| Icon | Panel | Size | What it shows |
|------|-------|------|---------------|
| ⚡ | **CPU** | half | Load %, core count, color-coded bar |
| 🧠 | **Memory** | half | Used/total, percentage, bar |
| 💾 | **Disk** | half | Used/total, mount point, bar |
| ⏱ | **Uptime** | half | Days/hours/minutes, hostname |
| ⚙️ | **Processes** | half | Total, running, sleeping, OS |
| 🔧 | **OpenClaw** | half | Version, sessions, memory, channel |
| 📊 | **Claude Usage** | full | 5hr + 7day quotas with reset timers |
| 📅 | **Crons** | full | Jobs list, status, run/disable actions |
| 🤖 | **Models** | full | Primary, fallback, sub-agent routing |

All panels are independent. Disable any in `config.json`. Add your own.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (54 tests across 21 suites)
npm test

# Smoke tests (integration — all API endpoints)
npm run smoke
```

Tests are co-located with panels (`core/panels/*/test.js`). Uses Node.js built-in test runner — no test framework dependencies.

## Customization

```json
{
  "name": "My Agent",
  "emoji": "🤖",
  "accent": "#c9a84c",
  "traits": ["Loyal", "Sharp", "Resourceful"],
  "quote": "I don't wait for permission."
}
```

| Color | Hex | Vibe |
|-------|-----|------|
| 🟡 Gold | `#c9a84c` | Classic, warm |
| 🔵 Cyan | `#00d2ff` | Tech, cool |
| 🟢 Emerald | `#10b981` | Fresh, calm |
| 🔴 Rose | `#f43f5e` | Bold, urgent |
| 🟣 Purple | `#a855f7` | Creative, deep |

## Architecture

See [`architecture.yaml`](./architecture.yaml) for the machine-readable spec, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for WHY decisions.

```

### Panel Contract v1.0

Each panel is a self-contained folder (`manifest.json` + `api.js` + `ui.js` + optional `test.js`). Panels receive standardized props (`data`, `error`, `connected`, `cls`, etc.), use scoped CSS via `cls()`, and are validated at startup with Elm-quality error messages. See [`CONTRACTS.md`](./CONTRACTS.md) for the full specification.

## Extending

Copy a template, edit, restart. Panels auto-discover. Hooks modify data flow. Routes auto-mount. Themes override CSS variables. See [`AGENT-EXTEND.md`](./AGENT-EXTEND.md) for the full guide.

## Security

- Telegram `initData` validated with **timing-safe HMAC-SHA256**
- Browser auth via **signed, httpOnly cookies**
- **Rate limiting** on all auth endpoints
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- WebSocket auth on connect
- No shell injection — all metrics via Node.js APIs
- `allowedUsers` whitelist in config

## For AI Agents

This is the killer feature: **your agent sets up the dashboard for you.**

Send your OpenClaw agent:

> Set up Clawboard from https://github.com/karthikeyan5/clawboard

It reads [`AGENT-SETUP.md`](./AGENT-SETUP.md), asks you a few questions in chat (bot token, domain), and handles:

- Cloning, config generation
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Systemd service
- BotFather webhook setup

Zero terminal. Zero DevOps. The agent does it all.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Keep it modular. One panel per folder. Tests required.

```bash
npm test
```
